# Software Requirements

Software requirements define what a system must be able to do. They can take various forms, making the process of documenting them flexible based on organizational practices, the nature of changes, and methodologies like Agile. Common methods include:

- **Requirement Statements:** Traditional format like "The system must do X" or "The user must be able to do Y," often divided into business, functional, or system requirements.
- **User Stories:** Popular in Agile, these use the "As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" structure to communicate requirements concisely. (Who, What and Why).
- **Diagrams:** Visual tools such as process flows, data models, or decision tables, help illustrate the bigger picture of how the system should function after changes.

Understanding different ways to document requirements allows business analysts and other professionals to adapt to specific project needs.
