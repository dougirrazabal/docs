# üß∞ Story Toolbox

Think about work situations‚Äîideally in the last 5 years‚Äîthat fall into the following categories. Write a short phrase that helps trigger the memory of the story. You may find some stories fitting into multiple categories‚Äîthat's okay. Aim for at least one unique story per category, and strive for two if you can.

**üí° Tip:** Some people prefer going category by category, using prompts to jog memories. Others like to list all their stories first and then assign them to categories. Try both and see what works best for you!
