# NeetCode Algorithms Roadmap

Status: ⚠️ WIP

## Research

LeetCode is challenging and should be approached as a difficult subject.

### Start with the basics

Master the core algorithms until you understand the reasoning behind each line of code:

- Binary Search
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Sliding Window
